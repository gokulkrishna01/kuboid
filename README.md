# Workbench - a distributed experimentation platform

This platform is designed to manage scientific experiments run in a distributed fashion through kubernetes.

Additionally, code here can be mined for useful snippets:
- using a Google Compute Engine persistent disk for shared storage (thanks to https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/examples/volumes/nfs)
- creating and formatting a GCE persistent disk
- authentication against different docker registries
